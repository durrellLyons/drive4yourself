                Welcome to Drive4Yourself.com!!!
                Im excited to see you take the opportunity to learn about this entrepreneurial avenue to make extra income
                on the side, or as a main hustle.
                But first, a little about myself.
            </p>
            
            <p>
                My name is Terrence McLaurin and I am an entrepreneur.
                I began driving for Uber in 2017 and have already seen a tremendous change in how my life works differently
                being my own boss.
                I was employed for 9 years with the same company, reached the top position at the job, and was also the
                highest paid employee.
                Good life right? 
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Well, not quite as good as you would imagine.
                Even though the amenities sound quite amazing, I felt like I spent so many hours of my day working for
                someone else’s dream.
                Some days would last 17-18 hrs, only to return again the next day and do the same.
                Indeed came the time for a change. 
            </p>
            
            <p>
                My first encounters with Uber were actually before the UberX and other levels were launched.
                Uber was previously a "Black-Car" service, but regular patrons like you and I, could use the app the same
                way we do today and request a ride.
                I became interested in what Uber had to offer and was very intrigued with the benefits and rewards I would
                see DAILY partnering with the company.
            </p>
            
            <p>
                I immediately filled out an application, got approved and instantly started making money.
                I was approved in less than a week and began changing my life.
                Now I work when I want to, play when I want to, eat when I want to, for as long as I want to.
                The best part of all, I GET PAID WHEN I WANT TO!!!!!
                Instant pay has done wonders in my life.
                As an Atlanta resident, Uber has allowed me to see many amazing parts and places of my own city that I had
                never seen before.
                Discovering new restaurants, new scenery, and a way to earn income while doing it was the best decision
                I’ve ever made.
            </p>
